This Arduino Passcode Authenticator project is a collaboration between myself and my coursework partner, aimed at creating a secure access system with a 6-input code (using buttons) to perform specific tasks.

Starting with the circuit design, we meticulously crafted the hardware setup to ensure reliable input detection and authentication. Once the circuit was in place, our focus shifted to programming the Arduino to enforce the predetermined passcode and execute predefined tasks based on the user's input.

Key Features:

- Secure Access System: Implement a 6-input passcode mechanism using buttons for authentication.
- Circuit Design: Develop a robust hardware setup to accurately detect user input.
- Task Execution: Define specific tasks to be performed upon successful authentication and enforce corresponding actions if the passcode is not met.
- Error Handling: Implement error detection and response mechanisms to handle incorrect passcode entries or system malfunctions gracefully.
- User Feedback: Provide visual and/or audible feedback to the user during the authentication process and task execution.

This project showcases our combined efforts in hardware design, programming, and problem-solving skills. Join us as we explore the intersection of physical computing and security in this Arduino Passcode Authenticator project.
